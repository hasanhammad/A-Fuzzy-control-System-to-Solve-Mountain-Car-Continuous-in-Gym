# A-Fuzzy-control-System-to-Solve-Mountain-Car-Continuous-in-Gym
Fuzzy logic is a powerful tool for developing control systems, especially in situations where there is a lot of uncertainty and imprecision. Here is one possible fuzzy system that could be used to solve the Mountain Car Continuous problem.

In this project, we Designed a fuzzy control system to solve the Mountain Car Continuous proplem.
